The file "Argentina well data test 2019.csv" contains a sample of well attribute data for Argentina wells. 

QUESTION: What issues can you find with the data that would need to be addressed to ensure the integrity 
of the data ahead of loading this into a database? 

ANSWER: If aggregating data from more than one source or if the values has been manually updated by people,
it's importante to certify that all values are consistent with the database datatypes expected. Also, it's
important to clean the data fields and remove duplicates.

        For example, The field 'well_number' has mixed types (string and integers) and should be treated.
If it's a large dataset, a good approach would be to create a unique integer index, and an auxiliary dictionary
table to optimize queries.

        In the case of number fields such as latitude, longitude and depth it's also important to verify if
it contains only floats and integers and apply some standardization rule in number of digits and decimals
before insert into a database.

        For dates and texts we should ensure that only valid date formats and right encoded characters are
being inserted into the database.
